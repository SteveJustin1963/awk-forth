# awk-forth
awk script to mimic forth commands


Creating a full Forth interpreter in Awk is a complex task, as Forth is a stack-based programming language with its own syntax and commands. a simple example that mimics a few basic Forth-like operations using Awk. This example will implement a stack and handle basic arithmetic operations.

to use script `forth.awk`) , make it executable using (`chmod +x forth.awk`). You can then use it to perform basic arithmetic operations in a Forth-like style by providing input on the command line:

```bash
./forth.awk "5 3 +"
```

This example script handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with integer operands. It's a simplified illustration of how you can mimic Forth-like commands in Awk. A full Forth interpreter would require a much more extensive implementation.
